<p>Between the old and new design, I saw a 36% overall increase in success rates among 10 common tasks on ServiceNow. I achieved this improvement by changing the information architecture and redesigning the request forms. Being able to support my design decisions with an understanding of employees' needs, frustrations, and existing mental models led to drastic changes.</p>
