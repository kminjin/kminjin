        <p>ServiceNow is an online resource for Lexmark employees to submit requests for any items or services. Many users have not been able to quickly and accurately find request forms specific to their needs. This has resulted in delays in users’ requests being met and additional work for the Facilities team since they need to redirect the requests to the proper channels. For Summer 2019, I worked on redesigning the Facilities and Site Operations section of ServiceNow.</p>

                    <p>Unfortuntely, there was not much data available. I was interested in finding out which requests were confused most frequently, which requests were the most popular, conversion rates, etc but specific information on each requests were not available. However, here are some general information they were able to give me from their system.
                    <li>4177 service requests in the past 12 months</li>
                    <li>Majority of requests "seemed" to be maintenance requests</li></p>

                        <p>Because there was not a lot of data, I wanted to gather my own before embarking on prototyping redesigns. Although I would have liked to learn more about specific quantitative data such as conversion rates, bounce rates, and times being spent on individual forms to get a more accurate view of the situation, I came to a conclusion that I only had 12 weeks at Lexmark and while this was my primary project, it would not be my only one. With the limited time available, I decided to collect success rates on 10 most common tasks. I phrased these ten tasks as real life cases instead of telling them what request form to submit because that was a major confusion in the process.</p>

                          <ol>1. After work-hours, items from people’s cubicles are disappearing. The group decides to install security cameras. Please submit a request.																									</ol>

                          <ol>3. You are a manager who wants to break the wall between two small meeting rooms and make it into one medium sized meeting room. Please submit a request.		</ol>
                <ol>4. A projector is broken. Please submit a request.			</ol>

  <ol>5. You need to ship a 1000 lb. equipment to China. Please submit a request.				</ol>


                  <ol>6. You recently got injured and will need to use a wheelchair for several months. The entry to your office does not have a automotive door, please submit a request.					</ol>

                        <ol>7. In your office, there is a 15ft x 5ft sized whiteboard hung up. It needs to be relocated into a different room. Please submit a request.																									</ol>
                          <ol>8. You want to move a couch out of your office. Please submit a request.																									</ol>
                          <ol>9. A cabinet has been in your office for the last ten years. You want to get it opened, but it is locked. Please submit a request																									</ol>

                          <ol>10. You have highly sensitive documents and you need a padlock for your door. Please submit a request.		</ol>

                              <li>For an ergonomic furniture request, there is a list of options to select however, not everyone knows what each option means and options that are either/or are checkboxes which allow for multiple selections. Make the information digestible, offer categories, use radio buttons rather than checkboxes, and offer help where needed with help icons.</li>
                              <li>For the overall request selection process, the titles for each request were not clear or sometimes representative of the request forms. Come up with a design that has helper text for each request form.</li>

                <p>After my first design concept, it was time for good old design review! Design reviews were one of my favorite moments at Lexmark. Although nerve-wrecking, the reaction from my team was positive! However, they did give me advice that was crucial: forms do not always have to display all the information at first load. This got me thinking about how I can incorporate interactions that were dynamic to clean up the forms. Up until this point, I was using XD to do the mockups but decided to move to Axure for prototyping because of its capabilities for including dynamic interactions.</p>

                <p>Showing initial prototypes on Axure made it really easy for the stakeholder to see how effective my changes would be. He was really happy about the progress! However, the developer informed me that although my three column design looked great, developers will only be able to code a two column design. A technical limitation that I did not know about was brought to light. After converting the forms to two columns from three, I was ready for another round of design review!</p>

                <p>For this second design review, we did a final walk through of the concept that has been revised twice since the last design review and devoted time working on strings! We learned from users that they value clarity and simplicity. With the other UX designers' advice, I decided that helper text/descriptions should be a list of services or items that can be submitted for each request form. </p>

                  <h4>Concern</h4>
                  <p>However, there were an area of concern. Goal #9 had a lower success rate this time around when compared to the old design. When people who failed the task were asked about their confusion, they stated that the wrongfully submitted form never indicated to them that they were in the wrong location. I made sure to incorporate that feedback in the last round of revisions before developer hand-off.</p>
