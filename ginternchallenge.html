        <h4 class=>First Design Problem: How to solve the problem</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>When taking part in a design project, I believe the first challenge is to steer away from formulaic solutions and predefined methods of the ‚Äústandard design process.‚Äù I spent some time thinking critically about how I wanted to tackle the process. I decided to skip the distribution of surveys and conduct more in depth interviews, and adapt usability tests to ‚Äúmicro-usability tests.‚Äù  I knew I wanted to opt out of distributing surveys because it would take time for responses to accumulate and I was more interested in cross questioning, and asking open ended questions rather than closed ended ones. Some other methods I determined to be indispensable were: competitive analysis, storyboards, mini-personas, sketching, paper prototyping, iteration of user testing, feedback, and revisions of my design, low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity mock-ups, and consideration of possible future directions.</p>

                    <li>In the filter option overlay, the large buttons as did not allow for many filtering options. I decided to keep it simple without diagrams and just make the options as small boxes you can check and uncheck for the low fidelity wireframe.</li>

                    <div class="col">
                      <li>Users might think they know what they dislike and like however, their thoughts do not always translate to their actions. Many students have stated they appreciate opinions of peers when considering which events to go to, but in testing, they thought it was unnecessary.</li>
                      <li>Product design is truly an intersection for all things. Research. Visual. Interaction. Testing.</li>
                      <li>Designing for less is sometimes designing for more. Although I wanted to include options such as ‚Äúsaved searches‚Äù and the ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù options, they only overwhelmed the users.</li>
                      <li>It can be fruitful to step back from the problem. Reading the design challenge prompt, designers might be quick to assume you need to separate categories by five types of events: sports, music, volunteering, visual arts, and social groups. However, there are so many social groups and when I gave myself a day to think about the project, I realized I should also filter out by DIFFERENT social groups. </li>
                      <li>I wish I could have devoted more time to need assessment and personas. I wish I had the time to send out meaningful surveys and get enough responses and spend a day or more on developing personas.</li>

                      <div class="col">
                      <li>I work well under pressure. At first I was intimidated by the project deadline since I was doing freelance design work, research, class, etc but it was so much fun! I only began studying UX design in September and in class we are encouraged to spend entire semesters on a project. I really pushed myself for this project and became more confident as a designer so thank you for giving me this project! </li>
                      <li>Users‚Äô wellness are my top priority. Even though I always knew this, this project further confirmed this for me! I decided to stay away from notifications because users are often overwhelmed by notifications and I wanted to set myself apart from solutions that measured engagement as the key metric. I didn‚Äôt want to resort to notifications to bring users back and wanted to measure success of my design by seeing if there is an increase from past years in number of people making it out to events. So instead, I gave users the option to add it to their Google Calendar if they wanted notifications. </li>
