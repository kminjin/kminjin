	                    <li>Majority of requests "seemed" to be maintenance requests</li></p>

					<h4>Main Takeaways</h4><p>Forms do not always have to display all the information at first load. This got me thinking about how I can incorporate interactions that were dynamic to clean up the forms. Up until this point, I was using XD to do the mockups but decided to move to Axure for prototyping because of its capabilities for including dynamic interactions.</p><br>
