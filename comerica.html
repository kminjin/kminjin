<h3>My work was important because </h3>
<p> 01 The animal agriculture industry produces roughly 18% of all produced greenhouse gas emissions (FAOUN, 2006).<br>
  02 This industry also utilizes an unsustainable amount of resources. 80-90% of US water consumption is utilized by the animal agriculture industries (USDA, 2016).<br>
  03 If everyone reduces their meat consumption, our earth will be healthier! </p>

	                    <li>4177 service requests in the past 12 months</li>
	                    <li>Majority of requests "seemed" to be maintenance requests</li></p>

					<h4>Main Takeaways</h4><p>Forms do not always have to display all the information at first load. This got me thinking about how I can incorporate interactions that were dynamic to clean up the forms. Up until this point, I was using XD to do the mockups but decided to move to Axure for prototyping because of its capabilities for including dynamic interactions.</p><br>
